## Overview

This project contains implementation of common data structures and algorithms for study and experimentation only.

## Credits

The project is based on concepts from the following texts;
- Algorithms, 4th edition, By Robert Segwick and Kevin Wayne
- The Algorithms Design Manual, 2nd Edition, By Steven S Skiena
- The Art of Computer Programming, By Donald Knuth

While most of the code is written from scratch, in some cases, it made sense to reuse methods and code from projects listed below, StackExchange forum discussions and other sources. Sources are referenced here as well as within code comments.
